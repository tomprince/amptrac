* Amptrac, A Completely Ridiculous Issue Tracker
I wrote this because twistedmatrix.com has a Trac instance full of
valuable data, and Trac has become increasingly annoying over the past
7 years. Amptrac is an attempt to provide a better face on that data.

** How It Works
Amptrac provides an AMP listeners in a Twisted-based server,
and a command-line client.

*** Server
AMP commands in amptrac.responder define the interface for working with
ticket data.

*** Client
XXX

** How To Run It
If you want to develop Frack, the tests can be run via 'trial
amptrac.test'. For running a development server:

# load some test data into an sqlite db
sqlite3 < frack/test/trac_test.sql trac.db

# start the server (the URL here must be the url at which you will
# access the site)
twistd -n amptrac --sqlite_db=trac.db


# After starting the server, you can then
bin/review-tickets
# or
bin/fetch-ticket <id>

Ticket numbers in the test database are: 3312, 5622, 5517, 2723, 4712.
