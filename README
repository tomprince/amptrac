* Frack, A Completely Ridiculous Issue Tracker
I wrote this because twistedmatrix.com has a Trac instance full of
valuable data, and Trac has become increasingly annoying over the past
7 years. Frack is an attempt to provide a better face on that data.

** How It Works
Frack provides AMP and JSON-RPC listeners in a Twisted-based server,
and a browser-based client.

*** Server
AMP commands in frack.responder define the interface for working with
ticket data. A JSON-RPC wrapper uses these same command objects to
define an HTTP-friendly interface.

*** Client
The web client lives in `webclient` and uses Dojo and Mustache. HTML
templating is done client side and communication with the server is
via JSON-RPC. BrowserID is used for authentication.
